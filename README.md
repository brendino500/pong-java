# 🏓 Pong

## ✨ Overview

- **The first language I explored when starting to study computer programme was Java** and I did find it incredibly difficult to get my head around it all. I then enrolled in a coding bootcamp which focuses on JavaScript and **transitioning from a strictly typed language into JavaScript was even more difficult.** I had definitely **missed the structure of Java.**

- Since completing the bootcamp I had noticed that **TypeScript is a language now being a requirement** for Junior Developers. Upon viewing some code in TypeScript and even going on the TypeScript website, I noticed how **similar it is to Java.** **This made me really excited to learn TypeScript.** 🤓

- I decided to code Pong from a codealong from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLirZqJFKPE) to help me get back into the **mind set of a strictly typed language before I properly study TypeScript.** This has been super useful and has actually **made me miss writing in Java.** 🤓 🤓 🤓

## 💾 Technologies and Tools

- JDK 15
- Java Extension Pack in VSCode

## 🕹 Game Instructions

Player 1

- W - Move UP
- S - Move DOWN

  <br />

Player 2

- ⬆️ - Move UP
- ⬇️ - Move DOWN

## 🧱 Process

- Creating all the classes and calling it in the Main file as a variable. All the other classes either extend and inherit from one another.

- In each class, the methods were created and gradually filled out as the game progressed.

## 🎊 Things I have learnt

- **I didn't know that you could code something visual in Java**. It was really fun following the tutorial and seeing it slowly built with packages Java already has such as `JFrame`.

- **A stronger foundation in strictly typed language and revising the knowledge I already had in Java.**

- A good refresher on `public`, `static`, `void` and `this` keywords as well as **defining types everywhere! ** A huge difference from JavaScript, but makes a lot of sense to me.

## 📨 Comments

- I really enjoyed doing this codealong. In future I will finish the Udemy course I have by Tim Bachalka because **I really like the syntax of Java and would love to explore to what extent Java is used for.**
